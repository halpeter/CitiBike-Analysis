## Analysis
The analyis of this data aimed to answer the following questions:

2. What are the most popular times, days of the week, and days of April?
3. What are the demographics of riders, looking at age and gender?
4. Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection by the end of April?

Each of these questions has a created dashboard that is displayed in the story board on the first tab of the tableau file.
