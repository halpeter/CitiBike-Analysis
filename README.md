# CitiBike-Analysis


## Background

This project utilizes data from the Citi Bike Program from April 2021, found on their [public webpage](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). This project analyzes this data and creates compelling visualizations in Tableau. These visualizations can be views [here](CitiBikeAnalysis.twbx).

## Analysis
The analyis of this data aimed to answer the following questions:
1. What are the top stations in the city for starting and ending a journey?
2. What are the most popular times, days of the week, and days of April?
3. What are the demographics of riders, looking at age and gender?
4. Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection by the end of April?

Each of these questions has a created dashboard that is displayed in the story board on the first tab of the tableau file.

### What are the top stations in the city for starting and ending a journey?
The top stations in the city are "1st Ave and E 68th St", "E 17th and Broadway", "Broadway and W 60th St", "W 21st and 6th Ave", and "Broadway and W 25th St". These are likely the top 5 stations due to their location. They are located in very high traffic areas of the city. Because of this, riders are more likely to drop off and pick up bikes there when they are arriving to and leaving these locations.

### What are the most popular times, days of the week, and days of April?
Surprisingly, the most popular time of the day in April 2021 was around 9:00pm at night. I would have expected the most popular times of day to align with rush hour for work. This difference, is possibly due to covid and far less people commuting to work. The most popular days of the week were Friday and Saturday which follows the previous theory that people are not riding to go to work but for pleasure. Finally, the most popular days of April were the 10th, the 20th, the 24th and the 28th. The 10th and the 24th align with the weekend and the other days were most likely popular due to weather.

### What are the demographics of riders, looking at age and gender?
The demographics seem skewed. There are a vastly larger number of riders born in the 1970s than any other decade, and significantly more male than female and other. This is potentially due to the fact that those are the defaults if a rider does not provide this information. When any other age demographic is selected there is a more normal spread of genders and vice versa.

### Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection by the end of April?
The following bikes (by ID) were used the most during April and likely need to be inspected and/or repaired: 
* 52272
* 51479
* 50607
* 49482
* 49321
* 50714
* 50036
* 49776
* 49519
* 52474
